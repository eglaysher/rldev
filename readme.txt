                 QUICK START GUIDE (WIN32 BINARY DISTRIBUTION)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installation:

  Unzip the distribution somewhere suitable.  If you are using Cygwin, the best
  place is /usr/local/share/rldev.  Otherwise, you will need to tell the
  programs where they are explicitly, by defining an environment variable RLDEV
  pointing to the folder you unzipped the program into (it will look for the
  data it needs in %RLDEV%\lib).

  Either add the bin\ subfolder to your path, or copy its contents to somewhere
  more appropriate (e.g. /usr/local/bin).


Usage:

  Basic usage information can be obtained by running `kprl --help',
  `rlc --help', `vaconv --help', and `rlxml --help'.  For more detailed 
  information, refer to the manual: an HTML version is included in the doc/ 
  subfolder, and a PDF version is available from http://dev.haeleth.net/.
